There are many ways you can contribute to build Cov19Tech into an informative resource for all to use:

- Contribute content such as writeups details
- Send feedback or suggest corrections
- Help with the design and coding of the website
- Share the site with friends, colleagues, and over social media

The easiest way for quick feedback is either through the [contact form](/contact) or by [sumitting an issue to the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cov19tech/cov19tech/issues)

Alternatively, the source code and content for the site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cov19tech/cov19tech), and pull requests can be submitted. The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/]). As is the HUgo standard, the content for the site is under the */content* folder. Data for the summary table is in the */data* folder. We welcome any pull requests.

Please don't hesitate to contribute - nothing is too small. Since many of the apps are only available regionally, we need help gathering information from users in different countries - the experience with the apps, screenshots, etc. We'd also love to hear from developers of the apps - if you are a developer of a contact tracing app, please do get in touch.
