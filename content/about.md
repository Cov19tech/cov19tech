Cov19Tech is an [open](https://github.com/Cov19tech/cov19tech) effort to document and share information on emerging technology being built to aid in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Cov19Tech focusses primarily on software & mobile technology, such as contact tracing apps, rather than life sciences technology (therpauetics, diagnostics, vaccines) being developed. The site is just getting started and we hope to add significant amounts of content in over the next few weeks.

The initial focus on Cov19Tech is to document the array of contact tracing applications being released by national and local governments worldwide. The information collected on these apps is intended to give a thorough overview of the approaches and tradeoffs. Although the information is intended for a technical audience, we are attempting to make it as accessible as possible to a broad range of interested parties.

We intend to branch beyond contracing tracing apps to internal health department tools, immunity passports, and other technologies as they evolve. 

Cov19Tech sends out a [newsletter](https://cov19tech.substack.com/archive) with updates and articles of interest once or twice a week. You can [sign up for updates here](https://cov19tech.substack.com/subscribe)

Cov19Tech was initiated by [Nosh Petigara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noshp) in May 2020.
